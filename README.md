# 📄 Automated Document Classification

An AI-powered system that classifies text documents into predefined categories using multiple Machine Learning algorithms.  
The project includes document preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation — all integrated into a simple and scalable Python-based application.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Text Preprocessing**  
  Removes stopwords, punctuation, and performs tokenization for cleaner input data.
- **Multiple Classification Models**  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Decision Trees  
  - K-Means (unsupervised clustering)
- **Easy Dataset Management**  
  Through the `DatasetManager` module.
- **Scalable Code Structure**  
  Modular Python files for each model and preprocessing task.
- **Flask Integration**  
  Simple web interface to interact with the classification models.
